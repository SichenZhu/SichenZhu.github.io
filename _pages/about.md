Hi, I am Sichen Zhu, a 2nd year Machine Learning PhD at Georgia Tech from Department of Biomedical Engineering. 

I'm generally interested in **computational biology and deep learning**. Specifically, I work on how deep learning can bring new solutions to tasks in single cell analysis in an efficient and effective manner. 

At Georgia Tech, I am affiliated with [Qiu Lab](https://mlb.bme.gatech.edu/). I am fortunate to work with Prof. [Peng Qiu](https://bme.gatech.edu/bme/faculty/Peng-Qiu) and many other incredible collaborators. Prior to that, I graduated with BS in Honors Mathematics from [NYU Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/). During my undergraduate study, I had the priviledge to work with Prof. [Hanghui Chen](https://www.hanghuichen.org/) on condensed matther physics.
